# ARoboCar

Unreal Engine car simulator for training our self driving car. Includes a scene capture class.

This project requires UnrealEnginePython. There  should be to add this dependency to the build
system, but for now just run the following commands ONCE.
```
>cd Plugins
>git clone https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython.git
```
The project will run the AIAgent.py from the current directory.
